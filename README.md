# ArduinoLED
LED implementation utilizing an Arduino uno.

The LED component contains 4 pins.
  3 pins control RGB values. They are each connected to pins 9, 10, 11 on the arduino uno respectively.
  Each RGB pin is connected with a 330 ohm resistor.
  The fourth pin is connected to a ground.

A function was created to modify the RGB values.
